# Pre-Bootcamp-Public
Work that I did before going live with Coding Dojo classes, without any prior knowledge of coding other than messing around with Marlin firmware for a 3D printer. 
Pre-Bootcamp was a small snippet of what classes would look like. I completed what I could with what instructional information given to me via the pre-bootcamp snippet course.
